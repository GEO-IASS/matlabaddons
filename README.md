# MATLAB Addons
Emanuele Ruffaldi @ SSSA 2015-2016

Simple package listing for automating the inclusion of libraries in MATLAB. The idea is to initialize/include libraries with a simple way similar to includes. Some packages require an initialization step in addition to the addpath, and in general we want to avoid to pollute the MATLAB path.

## Usage ##

1) clone
2) permanently addpath without recursion
3) when needed do mysetup(a,b,c) where a,b,c are names of packages provided
4) mysetup lists the packages

Some libraries are provided inside the git and updated from their upstreams. For larger libraries the download link is provided.

## Libraries ##
The following libraries are currently provided:
